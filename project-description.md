### Persistence Strategy

- **Local Storage**: Primary storage for names, settings, recent history
- **IndexedDB**: Enhanced storage for complete history and team data
- **File System**: Import/export for backup and sharing
- **User Settings**: Language preference, theme, sound settings, wheel configuration
- **No Server**: Privacy-focused, client-side only

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: XSS prevention in name inputs
- **File Upload Security**: CSV/JSON/Excel upload validation
- **Internationalization Security**: Translation XSS prevention, language code validation
- **UI Library Security**: NextUI dependency monitoring, theme injection prevention
- **OWASP Compliance**: Top 10 security practices
- **Package Security**: Vulnerability scanning and updates
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers implementation
