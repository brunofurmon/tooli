# 🎯 Tooli v1.2.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 Release Overview

**Version:** v1.2.0  
**Release Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

This release focuses on **complete wheel synchronization** and **UI polish**, addressing all user feedback and ensuring a reliable, accurate spinning wheel experience.

---

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### **1. Fixed Wheel Result Calculation**
- **Issue**: Wheel result didn't match visual position
- **Solution**: Implemented proper coordinate system mapping
- **Result**: Visual wheel position now perfectly matches declared winner

### **2. Enhanced Winner Modal**
- **Issue**: Modal background changed color with theme
- **Solution**: Consistent white background with dark text
- **Result**: Clean, professional appearance regardless of theme

### **3. Accurate Wheel Segments**
- **Issue**: All segments appeared equal size regardless of weights
- **Solution**: Segments now use actual probability calculations
- **Result**: Pie slices properly reflect weight distributions

### **4. Optimized Spin Experience**
- **Issue**: Wheel spun too fast and had delays
- **Solution**: 2-second spin duration with immediate response
- **Result**: Satisfying, visible spinning animation

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### **Winner Modal**
- ✅ Consistent white background (`#ffffff`)
- ✅ Dark text colors (`#333333`)
- ✅ No color changes when winner is selected
- ✅ Professional appearance in all themes

### **Weight Input Behavior**
- ✅ Inputs start from current calculated value
- ✅ No more starting from 0 when editing
- ✅ Real-time weight distribution updates
- ✅ Proper step increments (0.1)

### **Wheel Visual Improvements**
- ✅ Arrow points downward (correct direction)
- ✅ Segments reflect actual weight percentages
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Proper visual feedback

---

## ⚡ Performance & Reliability

### **Spin Performance**
- ✅ Eliminated async delays in wheel spinning
- ✅ Immediate response to user clicks
- ✅ Smooth 2-second animation duration
- ✅ Proper result calculation timing

### **Data Synchronization**
- ✅ Real-time wheel updates when weights change
- ✅ Proper user manager subscriptions
- ✅ Accurate probability calculations
- ✅ Consistent state management

### **Coordinate System**
- ✅ Fixed canvas vs. wheel coordinate mapping
- ✅ Proper pointer position calculation (270°)
- ✅ Accurate segment boundary detection
- ✅ Reliable result determination

---

## 🔧 Technical Fixes

### **Wheel Engine**
```typescript
// Before: Pure probability calculation
const result = wheelEngine.calculateResult();

// After: Position-based calculation
const result = calculateResultFromPosition(finalRotation, segments);
```

### **Coordinate System Mapping**
```typescript
// Canvas: 0°=right, 90°=down, 180°=left, 270°=up (pointer)
// Wheel: Segments start from currentRotation
const pointerAngle = 270; // Pointer position
const wheelAngle = (pointerAngle - normalizedRotation + 360) % 360;
```

### **Segment Drawing**
```typescript
// Before: Equal angles for all segments
const segmentAngle = 360 / segments.length;

// After: Probability-based angles
const segmentAngle = segment.probability * 2 * Math.PI;
```
